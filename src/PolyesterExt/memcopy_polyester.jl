NOTE on previous implementation with LoopVectorization: tturbo fails if src_flat and dst_flat are used due to an issue in ArrayInterface : https://github.com/JuliaArrays/ArrayInterface.jl/issues/228 TODO: once the package has matured check again if there is any benefit with: per=core stride=true
        @inbounds dst[i] = src[i]       # NOTE: We fix here exceptionally the use of @inbounds as this copy between two flat vectors (which must have the right length) is considered safe.
